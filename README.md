# Metro Art

A project that helps the visually impaired from artwork throughout the metro.

Artwork placed throughout the floor in metro stations across Vienna; a person that is visually disabled can aim their phone at the ground with the high probability they will scan a marker on the ground with directions of where to go, the app will talk back with directions according to the orientation the phone is facing in.

## 2 Modes
- adventure mode
- planned mode

## Adventure Mode

The user has not told the app the destination; therefore "is on an adventure", when the user scans the marker the app will say what will happen if they walk forward, when the user changes orientation the app will talk again. 

## Planned Mode

The user has told the app the destination; therefore, when the user scans the marker the app will say from the current orientation, where to walk to get to the intended destination.
